<h1> Password Generator </h1>

This project utilised HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript to create an application that an organisation's employees could use to generate random passwords based on criteria they personally selected. The main aim was to produce an app that would run in the browser displaying a clean and polished user interface but one that was also responsive and that could adapt to multiple screen sizes.

<h2>The URL of the deployed application: </h2>

https://jean-003.github.io/Password_Generator/

<h3>The URL of the GitHub repository that contains the code:</h3>

https://github.com/Jean-003/Password_Generator

<h2>Usage</h2>

To generate a password with a length between 8 and 128 characters (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters such as $@%&\*):

Click on the 'Generate Password' button. The user wil then be prompted to enter a number signifying the lenght of the password in the dialogue box. A series of 4 questions asking the user of what characters (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters such as $@%&\*) they would like included in the password follow. The user can click 'OK' to add character type or click 'Cancel' to exclude character type.

At the end of this, a password with the length and and characters specified by the user will be displayed above the 'Generate Password' button in the browser.

To test the responsive design of the password generator app on different screens sizes:

Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (macOS). This opens a console panel to the side of the webpage or below the webapage in the browser. Here, look for the devices icon to the left of the 'Elements' button. You can now manually input a specific size and check responsivenes. You can also click on the 'Dimentions' button usually located just below the website URL and choose a specific device from this button's drop down list.
